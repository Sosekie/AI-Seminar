1. How does few-shot learning work? Use Figure 1 to explain it.

P2

give some questions and answer for finetune and transfer the model to downstream tasks.

2. What kind of input can FLAMINGO take and what outputs does it produce?

P6

text, images and video.

text.

3. What is the main novelty in FLAMINGO? Use Figure 3 to illustrate it.



4. Explain eq. (1). What is the meaning of each term?



5. How does the perceiver resampler address inputs of different sizes?

P5

It takes as input a variable number of image or video features from the vision encoder and produces a fixed number of visual outputs.

6. Describe how the M3W dataset is built.

P6

7. Describe eq. (2) and the meaning of each term.

P6

8. What do we learn from Table 3?

P8

9. What are the main limitations of using frozen LMs?

P10

play a role in occasional hallucinations and ungrounded guesses

generalise poorly to sequences longer than the training ones. 

They also suffer from poor sample efficiency during training.

10. What are the possible negative societal impacts of FLAMINGO?

P10

Flamingo is exposed to the same risks as large language models, such as outputting offensive language, propagating social biases and stereotypes, as well as leaking private information

Its ability to additionally handle visual inputs poses specific risks such as gender and racial biases relating to the contents of the input images
