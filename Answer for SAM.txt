Answer for SAM

1. What is the promptable segmentation task?

P4

The promptable segmentation task, then, is to return a valid segmentation mask given any prompt. The requirement of a “valid” mask simply means that even when a prompt is ambiguous and could refer to multiple objects (e.g., recall the shirt vs. person example, and see Fig. 3), the output should be a reasonable mask for at least one of those objects.

2. How do the authors define the model in SAM?

3. What is the main issue with the data in SAM and how do the authors solve it?

a large and diverse set of masks, beyond any segmentation dataset that already exists. While a typical approach for foundation models is to obtain data online [82], masks are not naturally abundant and thus we need an alternative strategy.

4. Why do the authors perform a Responsible AI analysis?

Together, we hope this will make our work more equitable for real-world use cases.

5. Describe the zero-shot text-to-mask task and the results shown by the authors.
